    Problem 307
    ===========
    
    k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips
    produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and
    each defect is independent of the other defects).
    
    Let p(k,n) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3
    defects.
    For instance p(3,7) â‰ˆ 0.0204081633.
    
    Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal
    places in the form 0.abcdefghij
