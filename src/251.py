    Problem 251
    ===========
    
    A triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) is called a Cardano Triplet if it
    satisfies the condition:
    
    For example, (2,1,5) is a Cardano Triplet.
    
    There exist 149 Cardano Triplets for which a+b+c ≤ 1000.
    
    Find how many Cardano Triplets exist such that a+b+c ≤ 110,000,000.
