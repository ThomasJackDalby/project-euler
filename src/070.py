    Problem 70
    ==========
    
    Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is
    used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n
    which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are
    all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.
    The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive
    number, so φ(1)=1.
    
    Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a
    permutation of 79180.
    
    Find the value of n, 1 < n < 10^7, for which φ(n) is a permutation of n
    and the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum.
