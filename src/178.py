    ===========
    
    Consider the number 45656.
    It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a
    difference of one.
    A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of
    one is called a step number.
    A pandigital number contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least
    once.
    How many pandigital step numbers less than 10^40 are there?
