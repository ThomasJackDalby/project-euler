    Problem 42
    ==========
    
    
    The n^th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t[n] =
    Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
    
    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
    
    By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
    alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
    example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t[10]. If the word
    value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
    
    Using [1]words.txt, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common
    English words, how many are triangle words?
