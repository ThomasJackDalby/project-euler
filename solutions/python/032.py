    Problem 32
    ==========
    
    
    We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all
    the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is
    1 through 5 pandigital.
    
    The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
    multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
    
    Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
    identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
    
    HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to
    only include it once in your sum.
