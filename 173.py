    Problem 173
    ===========
    
    We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square
    "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For
    example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different
    square laminae:
    
    With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one
    time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.
    
    Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be
    formed?
