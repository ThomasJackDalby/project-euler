    ===========
    
    A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random
    order.
    
    What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that
    exactly 22 prime number discs are found away from their natural positions?
    (Any number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their
    natural positions.)
    
    Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point in the form
    0.abcdefghijkl.
