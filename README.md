# Project-Euler

This is a repo for my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). If you've not heard of Project Euler, and you're into maths, I'd defintley recommend checking it out. There's hundreds of mathematical problems which require coding to solve, and they start of easier before getting pretty insane. A good way to practice!

I've started solving them using python, but I think I might change it up and start to use a few other, more niche languages to have a  go.
