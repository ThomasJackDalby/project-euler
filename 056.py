    Problem 56
    ==========
    
    A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
    100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
    Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
    
    Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a, b < 100, what is
    the maximum digital sum?
