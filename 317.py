    Problem 317
    ===========
    
    A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks
    into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every
    direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.
    
    We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform
    gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s^2.
    
    Find the volume (in m^3) of the region through which the fragments move
    before reaching the ground. Give your answer rounded to four decimal
    places.
