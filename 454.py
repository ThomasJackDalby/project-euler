    Problem 454
    ===========
    
    In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.
    
    1   1   1
    ─ + ─ = ─
    x   y   n
    
    For a limit L we define F(L) as the number of solutions which satisfy x <
    y ≤ L.
    
    We can verify that F(15) = 4 and F(1000) = 1069.
    Find F(10^12).
