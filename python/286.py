    Problem 286
    ===========
    
    Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the
    probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance x is exactly
    (1 - ^x/[q]), where q is a real constant greater than 50.
    
    During each practice run, she takes shots from distances x = 1, x = 2,
    ..., x = 50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance
    to score a total of exactly 20 points.
    
    Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
