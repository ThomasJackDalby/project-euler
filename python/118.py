    Problem 118
    ===========
    
    Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form
    decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set
    {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.
    
    How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine
    exactly once contain only prime elements?
