    Problem 296
    ===========
    
    Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with BC ≤ AC ≤ AB.
    k is the angular bisector of angle ACB.
    m is the tangent at C to the circumscribed circle of ABC.
    n is a line parallel to m through B.
    The intersection of n and k is called E.
    
    How many triangles ABC with a perimeter not exceeding 100 000 exist such
    that BE has integral length?
