    Problem 91
    ==========
    
    The points P (x[1], y[1]) and Q (x[2], y[2]) are plotted at integer
    co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.
    
    There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be
    formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
    0 ≤ x[1], y[1], x[2], y[2] ≤ 2.
    
    Given that 0 ≤ x[1], y[1], x[2], y[2] ≤ 50, how many right triangles can
    be formed?
