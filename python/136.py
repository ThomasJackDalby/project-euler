    Problem 136
    ===========
    
    The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic
    progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x^2 − y^2 −
    z^2 = n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:
    
    13^2 − 10^2 − 7^2 = 20
    
    In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the
    equation has a unique solution.
    
    How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
