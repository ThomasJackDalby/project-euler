    Problem 208
    ===========
    
    A robot moves in a series of one-fifth circular arcs (72Â°), with a free
    choice of a clockwise or an anticlockwise arc for each step, but no
    turning on the spot.
    
    One of 70932 possible closed paths of 25 arcs starting northward is
    
    Given that the robot starts facing North, how many journeys of 70 arcs in
    length can it take that return it, after the final arc, to its starting
    position?
    (Any arc may be traversed multiple times.)
